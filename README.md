=================

This is a Scrapy project to accompany by blog article '[Scraping and querying data from websites](http://flyingtophat.co.uk/blog/2015/12/08/scraping-and-querying-data-from-websites.html)'. When run it will scrape popular baby-names from around the word from [BabyNameWizard](http://www.babynamewizard.com/).
